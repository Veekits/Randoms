Subject: RE: SPECIAL ORDER

 

Dear Brenda,

 

We did the attached special order which the supplier has delivered at a higher price than the LPO (sh. 4277.86). The supplier says they have adjusted the price hence can’t be able to supply at LPO price.

 

Kindly advise if we should go ahead and receive or return back to supplier considering we have a client urgently waiting for the medication.

 

Kind regards,
